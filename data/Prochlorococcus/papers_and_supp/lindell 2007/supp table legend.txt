Supplementary Table 3: Upregulated Prochlorococcus MED4 genes determined from microarray analysis. Fold change (infected/control) with
time (h) after infection. Positive and negative values indicate an increase and decline in transcript levels respectively. Significant increases in fold
change are shown in blue and the level of significance is shown: * for q<0.05; ** q<0.01; ***q<0.001.
