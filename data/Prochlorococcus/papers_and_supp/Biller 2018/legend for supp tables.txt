Legend for supplementary Table S3
All Prochlorococcus transcripts found to be significantly differentially abundant at any time point between 36 and 48 h (1 to 13 h in extended darkness). Values indicate log2 fold change in cultures experiencing extended darkness versus 13:11 light:dark controls. Statistically significantly different transcript abundances (as determined by DESeq2 at a corrected P value of <0.1) are indicated by three asterisks. Download TABLE S3, XLSX file, 0.3 MB.

Legend for supplementary Table S6
(A) Number of significantly differentially abundant Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002 transcripts between cultures remaining in the diel light:dark cycle versus extended darkness. All differences were statistically significant as determined by DESeq2 and a corrected P value of <0.1. Percentages reflect the fraction of all 4,213 annotated MIT1002 protein-encoding genes. (B) Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002 transcripts consistently differentially abundant following 1 to 5 h of extended darkness. Values indicate log2 fold change in extended darkness versus diel controls. All differences were statistically significant as determined by DESeq2 and a corrected P value of <0.1. Download TABLE S6, XLSX file, 0.04 MB.
