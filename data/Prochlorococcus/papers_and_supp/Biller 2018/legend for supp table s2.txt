Legend for supplementary Table S2 (excel file)
The supplementary excel file includes the expression values for each of the co-cultures and the axenic cultures (with 0.01 added to enable the calculation of fold change) and the q-value ( as calculated by Rockhopper), followed by the log2 fold change. Differentially expressed genes (fold change >2, q value <0.05, expression >0 under both conditions, colored) are followed by genes not differentially expressed (in black), each group organized by fold change. The prochlorosin (ProcA), CCRG-1 and CCRG-2 genes are highlighted in orange, green and dark pink, respectively.
