Supplementary Table 2. Prochlorococcus MIT9313 genes with differentially abundant transcripts after vDOM addition
Transcript abundances of the vDOM amended cultures were normalized to those of the control cultures amended with the Pro99 growth medium. For each log2 fold change, * indicates a significant change (adjusted p-value < 10%, and log2 fold change bigger than 1 or smaller than -1).
Genes with differentially abundant transcripts at two time points are highlighted.
