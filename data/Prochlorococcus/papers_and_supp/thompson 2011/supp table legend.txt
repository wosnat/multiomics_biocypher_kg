Supplementary Table 1: Fold change and cluster membership of MED4 genes that are differentially expressed in
response to changing iron availability.
- All values indicate log2(-Fe/+Fe) with the exception of R where values are log2(experimental treatment after iron
addition/experimental treatment before iron rescue).
- Values in bold print have q-values<0.01. Values in red bold print have q-values<0.01 and log2(fold change) greater than
1 or less than -1.
values with q-values <0.01 are marked with * and those with log2(fold change) greater than 1 or less than -1 are marked with **

The numerical values in the table represent log2(−Fe/+Fe), except for the R∗ column, which represents the log2 fold change after iron addition.

* Following iron addition to experimental treatment (R) – See Methods.
° Hierarchical clustering. Gene expression profiles of each cluster shown in Figure 3.
† Prochlorococcus core gene.
‡ MED4-MIT9313 shared gene (bi-directional ortholog of MED4 and MIT9313).



Supplementary Table 2: Fold change and cluster membership of MIT9313 genes that are differentially
expressed in response to changing iron availability.

- All values indicate log2(-Fe/+Fe) with the exception of R where values are log2(experimental treatment after iron

- Values in bold print have q-values<0.01. Values in red bold print have q-values<0.01 and log2(fold change) greater
than 1 or less than -1.
