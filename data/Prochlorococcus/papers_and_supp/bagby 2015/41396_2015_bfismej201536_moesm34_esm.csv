"Table S2.  Concordance between MED4 transcriptional responses to high light shock, –CO2 shock, and –CO2/–O2 shock",,,,,,,
Notes to Table S2,,,,,,,
1 Loci for which CyanoBase gene categories were changed by manual curation are marked with an asterisk.,,,,,,,
"2 Where gene categories were changed by manual curation, original CyanoBase classifications are given in square brackets.  Gene categories:  A, amino acid 
biosynthesis; B, biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers; C, cell envelope; D, cellular processes; E, central intermediary metabolism; F, energy 
metabolism; G, fatty acid, phospholipid, and sterol metabolism; H, photosynthesis and respiration; I, purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, and nucleotides; J, regulatory 
functions; K, DNA replication, recombination, and repair; L, transcription; O, translation; P, transport and binding proteins; R, RNA; U, other categories; Z, hypothetical 
proteins.",,,,,,,
"3 At t = 45 min of high light shock.  Changes in expression were assessed by comparison to parallel cultures kept in the dark (Steglich et al., 2006; 
Steglich et al., 2008).",,,,,,,
"4 Direction of initial change, as indicated by cluster membership:  cluster 1, up; clusters 2, 3, and 4, down.  See Fig. 2C for cluster profiles.",,,,,,,
5 As indicated by membership in cluster 3.  See Fig. 2B for cluster profiles.,,,,,,,
