    <h1>Tolonen <i>et al.</i> 2006:  Best motifs common to both MED4 and MIT9313 K-means clusters</h1>
    <p>CompareACE was used to compare all MIT9313 and all MED4 motifs generated from all runs, in order to find motifs in common to both <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains. The first motif shown has a CompareACE score of >.7 (a frequently used statistical threshold) emerged. This motif has a relatively weak MAP score in each organism, but is fairly specific in each (with specificity score <1e-4 in each).</p>
