    <h1>Tolonen <i>et al.</i> 2006:  Kmeans Cluster P-values</h1>
    <p>Once K had been chosen, we evaluated the enrichment of individual clusters for different gene categories using hypergeometric P-values <a href="./clustering.pdf">(click here for details)</a>. These P-values show the probability that a given cluster would be enriched for a given functional category due to chance alone. These P-values were weighted to account for multiple hypotheses using two significance thresholds. The first method accounts for all functional categories at all values of K evaluated and thus P < 0.05/(C*S). C is the number of functional categories, 8 for MED4 and 10 for MIT9313. S is the sum of all K values tested (here 2 to 20) equal to 209. This significance is P<2.99e-5 for MED4 and P<2.39e-5 for MIT9313. The second, more permissive, significance threshold accounts for each of the functional categories tested at one value of K and thus P < 0.05/(C*K). Below are the MED4 and MIT9313 P-values for the functional enrichment of clusters for each functional category.</p>
