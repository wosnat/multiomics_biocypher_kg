Supplementary Table 1. Expression data for all genes with significant changes in at least one light condition compared to dark or DCMU compared to
white light, respectively.
Significant expression ratios (≥2-fold and FDR ≤ 0.05) are indicated by *. Positive values indicate induction and negative values reduction
of gene expression upon transfer to the respective light treatment. HL – high white light; WL – white light, BL – blue light; RL – red light; GL – green
light; DCMU – DCMU + white light.
