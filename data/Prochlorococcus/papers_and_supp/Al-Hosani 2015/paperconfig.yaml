      condition_type: growth_medium
      name: Normal seawater control (3.8% salt)
      medium: PRO99 natural seawater medium
      temperature: 22C
      light_condition: continuous_light
      light_intensity: 46 µmol photons m-2 s-1
      salinity: 3.8% w/v NaCl
      description: Axenic Prochlorococcus AS9601 grown in PRO99 natural seawater medium (Sargasso Sea water) at 22C under continuous illumination (~46 µmol photons m-2 s-1), normal seawater salinity (3.8% w/v)
    alhosani_2015_salt_acclimation:
      condition_type: salt_stress
      name: Salt-acclimated (5% salt)
      medium: PRO99 natural seawater medium with added NaCl
      temperature: 22C
      light_condition: continuous_light
      light_intensity: 46 µmol photons m-2 s-1
      salinity: 5% w/v NaCl
      description: Axenic Prochlorococcus AS9601 acclimated to 5% (w/v) NaCl by consecutive transfers for 3 generations in PRO99 medium with added ultra-pure NaCl, at 22C under continuous illumination (~46 µmol photons m-2 s-1). Cells exhibited slower growth rate (doubling time ~2.65 days vs ~1.26 days for control)
