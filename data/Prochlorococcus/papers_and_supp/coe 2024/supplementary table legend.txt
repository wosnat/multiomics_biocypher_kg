Supplemental Table 1. RNA-seq statistics for both Prochlorococcus and Alteromonas. Total
library size, reads mapped to either Prochlorococcus NATL2A or Alteromonas macleodii
MIT1002 genomes, and transcripts that are aligned to each ORF (sense orientation).

Supplemental Table 2. Significantly differentially abundant Prochlorococcus transcripts.
Values represent log2 fold change for every time point. Statistically significantly differential
transcript abundances are designated by “***” (p < 0.01).

Supplemental Table 3. Gene periodicity patterns in Prochlorococcus cells. Based on the
periodicity pattern, genes in parental and dark-tolerant cells were clustered into 15 clusters. If a
gene in both parental and dark-tolerant cells was found in the same cluster, the pattern was
marked “true”, and if not, as “false”.

Supplemental Table 4. Significantly differentially abundant Alteromonas transcripts. Values
represent log2 fold change for every time point. Statistically significantly differential transcript
abundances are designated by “***” (p < 0.01).

Supplemental Table 5. Differential abundance of Alteromonas transcripts involved in diverse
substrate catabolism. Values represent log2 fold change for every time point. Statistically
significantly differential transcript abundances are designated by “***” (p < 0.01).
