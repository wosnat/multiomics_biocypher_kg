 # Why Use Generative AI to Study Omics?

## What is Omics?

Omics is the ability to sequence living cells, which opens up a world of questions: What's someone's DNA? How does it differ from others? What mutations do they carry? What bacteria live in our guts?

But it goes deeper. We can ask which genes are currently activated, which ones are being transcribed into the proteins and enzymes that actually do the work in your cells. This unlocks powerful research:

- Compare people with diabetes to those without, and spot the genetic differences
- Study what's happening in a diabetic's pancreas vs. a healthy one. Why isn't insulin being produced the same way?
- Investigate how bacteria in your gut interact. Do they help each other or compete?
- Understand the mechanisms pathogens use to cause disease

Omics exploded over the last 30-40 years, starting with the massive, multi-billion-dollar effort to sequence the human genome. That took forever.

Now? You can plug a little sequencer into your laptop and do it yourself. It's cheap. It's easy. So everyone is sequencing everything: people, animals, plants, bacteria, seawater, soil, air. You name it.

Want to breed sweeter tomatoes? Sequence them, identify which gene mutations make them sweet, and select accordingly. Simple.

So we've solved this, right? We have the tools, people are using them, and we're making great discoveries. Problem solved.

## Why Do We Need Generative AI?

Here's the thing: even though we've had these tools for a while now, we still have massive holes in our knowledge.

Let's look at messenger RNA sequencing. It tells us which genes are currently being transcribed to make the enzymes doing the actual work in cells. That's straightforward enough. We sequence mRNA, and we get a list of active genes compared to some control. Easy.

But then what? We have roughly 20,000 genes in the human genome. If 3,000 of them are upregulated right now, what does that actually *mean*? How do you make sense of it?

People have thought about this before, and they came up with clever solutions. One approach: group genes into pathways. So you might say, "Fifty of those 3,000 upregulated genes are involved in amino acid synthesis. Maybe the cell is working on that right now." That works, but it's limited. Many genes play roles in multiple pathways, including energy metabolism. How do you know what the cell is actually prioritizing?

Another approach: take all the genes with known chemical reactions, plug them into a massive metabolic model with cascading reactions, and see what molecules the cell is actually producing. This kind of metabolic modeling is gaining momentum.

But here's where it gets interesting. All of this is still somewhat simplistic. We're not really leveraging the hundreds of sequencing studies that have been published in recent years. So I started asking myself: what if we took all those studies, fed them to an AI model, and asked it to help us understand a new study in the context of everything we already know? That holistic approach might actually give us real insights.

In the next post, I'll talk about how to actually do this. Stay tuned.
