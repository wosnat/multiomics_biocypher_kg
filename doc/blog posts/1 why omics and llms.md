# Multi-omics analysis using generative AI

# Why use generative AI to analyze omics data?


## what is omics? 
Omics is the ability to sequence the living cells which allows us to ask questions, like what is the DNA of this person and how is it different from everyone else?  what mutations do they have? what are the bacteria in our guts?

 you can also ask things like which of the Genes is currently activated so what is are the Genes that are currently being transcribed into protein enzymes? Which lets you ask questions like what are the enzymes that are active right now? so that allows you to do a lot of things. one thing you can do is, you can say okay let me compare people with diabetes with people without diabetes and see if we can find what is the genetic mutations that cause diabetes . and one thing you can say is you can say okay then this person has diabetes let's see what happens in the pancreas where insulin supposed to be made like what is the difference between insulin generation in healthy person versus someone with diabetes or you can say okay let me see what is the interaction between the different bacteria in the human guts like how do they work together or against each other and how what is the mechanisms that  pathogens are using to create disease and so many things.  Omics sequencing  really exploded in the last  30-40 years .  starting with the sequencing of the human genome. the human genome took years to sequence . it was multi billion dollars project . 

 this has become so much more easier and so much more cheaper that you can basically now take this dongle, plug it into your laptop, and sequence. it's so much easier now and that means that we have lots and lots of sequencing studies.   everyone is sequencing everything and not just people . We sequence animals, plants, bacteria , sea water, soil, air, everything. 

For example , you want to generate sweeter Tomatoes.  you can sequence tomatoes to identify which mutations in the Genes makes them sweet, and then you can basically use that to select the plants you like.

## the limitations of current approaches to omics studies 

There are   so many things you can do, so this is basically a solved problems , right?

 we have this mechanism in place and people are using it , have been using it for a while , and we made so many great discoveries.

 why do we need generative AI? because even though we know these things for a long time, we still have a lot of holes in our knowledge.

to demonstrate let's think about messenger RNA sequencing , which basically tells us which genes are currently being transcribed to generate the enzymes in the cell.
  basically which genes does the organism currently choose to used to generate enzymes and these enzymes will catalyze chemical reactions in the cell .
we can sequence mRNA , that's easy.  but what's next?   we can say okay, let's see  what is the activity of each gene versus some control and so we can say okay these are the genes that are currently being activated this is what the cell is currently choosing to do. for many of these genes we know the function for some we don't.
 we have  ~20,000 genes in the human genome. what does it mean that 3,000 out of 20,000 genes are currently being transcribed ? it's really hard to make sense of .  here we can stand on the shoulders of giants.  people have thought about this problems before us , so they came up with all sorts of ideas .  one option that people have done is to take all of these genes and categorize them into different pathways and then we can say that out of 3000 upregulated genes, fifty belong to this pathway that is synthesizing amino acids so maybe this cell is working on synthesizing amino acids.  that's a good thing to do but it has limitations because many of these genes are also used in the cell energy pathways .  so how do we know which of them is actually the main thing that the cell is trying to do?

 another option is to take all of these genes where we know the chemical reactions that they catalyze and plug them into this huge equation that has all of the different reactions like a Cascade of reactions and that allows us to see what are the molecules that are being generated.
this kind of metabolic modeling has been Gathering momentum. 

## why do we want to use generative AI to study omics? 

 still all of this is a little bit simplistic and it doesn't really leverage from all of these hundreds of a sequencing studies that have been done in recent years. the question I ask myself is,  can we take all of these studies, feed them to an AI model and ask it what can we make sense of a new study that we're doing now in the context of everything we already know. hopefully this holistic this holistic approach will give us better insights.
 on the next block post I am going to discuss how to go about it so stay tuned
