      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene ( idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.",

Experiments showed that salt acclimated cells exhibit slower growth rates with a doubling time almost twice as controls. Approximately 1/3 of the genome was found to be differentially expressed (p-value <0.05), but a considerably large number of these genes are \"hypothetical proteins\" with unknown function. Transcript abundance were higher for genes involved in respiratory electron flow, carbon fixation, osmolyte/compatible solute biosynthesis and inorganic ion transport. Many of the highly expressed genes are \u2018high light inducible proteins\u2019 believed to be part of the general Prochlorococcus stress response. Transcript abundance were lower for genes involved in photosynthetic electron transport and cell division.

While these phototrophs are primarily considered free-living and neutrally buoyant in the euphotic zone, we observe that they can form biofilms on diverse substrates. This trait is conserved across Prochlorococcus ecotypes, and populations continuously transition between planktonic and biofilm states via a non-genetic heritable mechanism. Throughout their growth, cells in biofilms retain a reversible, dynamic attachment state, and measurements of growth, photosynthesis, and respiration rates reveal that cells in biofilms exude more organic carbon than their planktonic counterparts. Estimates of the fraction of Prochlorococcus cells attached to particles in the ocean reveal that a significant adherent population exists throughout the euphotic and mesopelagic zones.

Genome-wide transcription profiling after acute limitation of CO2, O2, or both revealed that O2 limitation caused smaller transcriptional changes than CO2 limitation and CO2/O2 co-limitation. CO2 limitation triggered responses similar to high-light stress; later, O2-dependent recovery of photosynthesis-related transcripts emerged, suggesting oxygen plays a protective role when carbon fixation cannot sink absorbed light energy.",

Pathway analyses showed differential transcription in carbohydrate metabolism, stress response, and chemotaxis, with distinct patterns depending on the cyanobacterial partner. Transporter and catabolic gene expression suggested altered nutrient availability in media under elevated pCO2. The results imply that changes in cyanobacterial excretions under high pCO2 could drive broad ecophysiological shifts in both EZ55 and its cyanobacterial partners, potentially impacting marine carbon cycling. In MIT9312/EZ55 cocultures at 800 ppm pCO2, oxidative stress genes were notably downregulated, consistent with a hypothesized reduction in photorespiratory byproducts and lower oxidative stress in EZ55, offering a potential explanation for the reduced \u2018help\u2019 provided to MIT9312 under elevated pCO2.",

      "abstract": "Microbes evolve within complex ecological communities where biotic interactions impact both individual cells and the environment as a whole. Here we examine how cellular regulation in the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is influenced by a heterotrophic bacterium, Alteromonas macleodii, under different light conditions. We monitored the transcriptome of Prochlorococcus, grown either alone or in coculture, across a diel light:dark cycle and under the stress of extended darkness\u2014a condition that cells would experience when mixed below the ocean\u2019s euphotic zone. More Prochlorococcus transcripts exhibited 24-h periodic oscillations in coculture than in pure culture, both over the normal diel cycle and after the shift to extended darkness. This demonstrates that biotic interactions, and not just light, can affect timing mechanisms in Prochlorococcus, which lacks a self-sustaining circadian oscillator. The transcriptomes of replicate pure cultures of Prochlorococcus lost their synchrony within 5 h of extended darkness and reflected changes in stress responses and metabolic functions consistent with growth cessation. In contrast, when grown with Alteromonas, replicate Prochlorococcus transcriptomes tracked each other for at least 13 h in the dark and showed signs of continued biosynthetic and metabolic activity. The transcriptome patterns suggest that the heterotroph may be providing energy or essential biosynthetic substrates to Prochlorococcus in the form of organic compounds, sustaining this autotroph when it is deprived of solar energy. Our findings reveal conditions where mixotrophic metabolism may benefit marine cyanobacteria and highlight new impacts of community interactions on basic Prochlorococcus cellular processes.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus is found throughout the euphotic zone in the oligotrophic open ocean. Deep mixing and sinking while attached to particles can, however, transport Prochlorococcus cells below this sunlit zone, depriving them of light for extended periods of time. Previous work has shown that Prochlorococcus by itself cannot survive extended periods of darkness. However, when co-cultured with a heterotrophic microbe and subjected to repeated periods of extended darkness, Prochlorococcus cells develop an epigenetically inherited dark-tolerant phenotype that can survive longer periods of darkness. Here we examine the metabolic and physiological changes underlying this adaptation using co-cultures of dark-tolerant and parental strains of Prochlorococcus, each grown with the heterotroph Alteromonas under diel light:dark conditions. The relative abundance of Alteromonas was higher in dark-tolerant than parental co-cultures, while dark-tolerant Prochlorococcus cells were larger, contained less chlorophyll, and were less synchronized to the light:dark cycle. Meta-transcriptome analysis revealed that dark-tolerant co-cultures undergo a joint change, in which Prochlorococcus undergoes a relative shift from photosynthesis to respiration, while Alteromonas shifts toward using more organic acids instead of sugars. Furthermore, the transcriptome data suggested enhanced biosynthesis of amino acids and purines in dark-tolerant Prochlorococcus and enhanced degradation of these compounds in Alteromonas. Collectively, our results demonstrate that dark adaptation involves a strengthening of the metabolic coupling between Prochlorococcus and Alteromonas, presumably mediated by an enhanced, and compositionally modified, carbon exchange between the two species.",

      "abstract": "We conducted transcriptomic analyses to study the effects of viral DOM (vDOM) on the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MIT9313. Growth was unaffected by vDOM, but tRNAs increased in abundance; tRNA-Gly increased with glycine. Decreased transcript abundances of nitrogen metabolism genes suggested uptake of organic nitrogen from vDOM. vDOM reduced maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and CO2 fixation while increasing respiration, with transcriptomic changes linked to photosynthesis and respiration. The 6S RNA showed high fold-change, indicating a regulatory role in response to viral lysis products. These results suggest transcriptional regulation and metabolic potential of Prochlorococcus to utilize organic nitrogen from viral lysis products.",

Elevated CO2 prolonged Prochlorococcus lag phase and increased die-off after transfers, suggesting higher oxidative stress. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed reduced expression of the carbon fixation operon and carboxysome subunits in Prochlorococcus, with fewer carboxysome structures observed by electron microscopy. Prochlorococcus co-culture responsive gene 1 was upregulated under elevated CO2, indicating a shift in microbial interactions. Alteromonas displayed decreased catalase expression and hydrogen peroxide removal rates by approximately sixfold in co-culture, implying reduced ROS detoxification support for Prochlorococcus under high CO2. These findings suggest elevated CO2 could alter microbial interactions and the ecosystem services provided by helper bacteria in the ocean.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus play a crucial role in the ocean\u2019s biogeochemical cycling, but it remains controversial how they will respond to global warming. Here we assessed the response to temperature (22\u201330 \u00b0C) of the growth dynamics and gene expression profiles of a Red Sea Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) in a non-axenic culture. Both the specific growth rate (0.55\u20130.80 day\u22121) and cell size (0.04\u20130.07 \u03bcm3) of Prochlorococcus increased significantly with temperature. The primary production released extracellularly ranged from 20% to 34%, with humic-like fluorescent compounds increasing up to fivefold as Prochlorococcus reached its maximum abundance. At 30 \u00b0C, genes involved in carbon fixation such as CsoS2 and CsoS3 and photosynthetic electron transport including PTOX were downregulated, suggesting a cellular homeostasis and energy saving mechanism response. In contrast, PTOX was found upregulated at 22 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C. Similar results were found for transaldolase, related to carbon metabolism, and citrate synthase, an important enzyme in the TCA cycle. Our data suggest that in spite of the currently warm temperatures of the Red Sea, Prochlorococcus can modulate its gene expression profiles to permit growth at temperatures lower than its optimum temperature (28 \u00b0C) but is unable to cope with temperatures exceeding 30 \u00b0C.",

      "abstract": "The transcriptomic responses of bacteria to environmental stresses have been studied extensively, yet we know little about how stressed cells respond to bacteriophage infection. Here, we conducted the first whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) study of stressed bacteria to phage infection by infecting the marine picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus NATL2A with cyanomyovirus P-SSM2 under phosphorus limitation. Transcript levels of the P-acquisition genes in uninfected cells were enriched under P limitation, including pstS, and these were still enriched in infected cells under P-limited conditions. In contrast, transcripts of ATP synthase and ribosomal protein genes were depleted under P limitation but enriched during phage infection of P-starved cells. Cyanophage P-SSM2 contains pstS, and pstS and its adjacent gene g247 of unknown function were the only phage genes enriched under P-limited conditions. The host pstS transcript number per cell decreased after infection but remained higher in the P-limited infected cells than in nutrient-replete cells; phage pstS transcripts per cell were ~20-fold higher than host pstS, potentially maintaining host phosphate uptake during infection.",

Only seven up-regulated genes were common to both strains, including phoB and pstABCS and a downstream porin likely encoding phoE. Novel P-starvation\u2013associated genes were observed, frequently clustered near phoB (downstream gap1 and mfs) suggesting roles in P scavenging. The phoB-containing cluster varied across 11 Prochlorococcus strains, not strictly correlated with rRNA phylogeny, implying genome variability related to environmental phosphate availability.
