      "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) often limits biological productivity in ocean gyres where Prochlorococcus is most abundant. The study quantified changes in MED4 and MIT9313 global mRNA expression, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosystem II photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) along a time series of increasing N starvation. It also compared global expression when grown in ammonium-replete medium versus alternative N sources. The results show interstrain similarities, such as activation of a putative NtcA regulon during N stress, and differences in carbon metabolism gene expression, suggesting fundamentally different integration of N and C metabolism between the strains.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene ( idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.",

The study measured global gene expression under short-term exposure to white, blue, red, and green light and light quantities using microarrays. Blue light triggered the strongest transcriptional response; high-white light response resembled blue light, suggesting blue-light\u2013mediated sensing. Bacterial cryptochromes are proposed as candidate blue-light sensors, and there is evidence for a signaling pathway related to the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, inferred from genes responding to red and blue light and to the inhibitor DCMU.
