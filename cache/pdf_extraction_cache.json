The Alteromonas strain enhances MIT9313 growth at low density but inhibits it at higher density, with no effect on MED4. Early transcriptomic responses show no nutrient-starvation signatures; MED4 downregulates photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and stress response genes, while MIT9313 upregulates these pathways. Differential expression of outer membrane modification genes, efflux transporters, and lanthipeptide-related genes (prochlorosins) suggests a targeted response to the heterotroph. Novel co-culture responsive gene families (CCRG-1 and CCRG-2) are encoded by many short genes and may be released into the medium.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene ( idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.",

Only seven up-regulated genes were shared, largely including phoB and pstABCS; a phoE-like porin downstream of phoB was induced in both strains. The results reveal two clusters of P-acquisition genes centered around phoB, with significant genome variability in the phoB region across 11 strains, not strictly correlated with rRNA phylogeny.

      "abstract": "The transcriptomic responses of bacteria to environmental stresses have been studied extensively, yet we know little about how stressed cells respond to bacteriophage infection. Here, we conducted the first whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) study of stressed bacteria to phage infection by infecting the marine picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus NATL2A with cyanomyovirus P-SSM2 under P limitation, a strong selective force in the oceans. Transcripts of the P-acquisition genes in the uninfected cells were enriched after P limitation, including the high-affinity phosphate-binding protein gene pstS. They were still enriched in the infected cells under P-limited conditions. In contrast, transcripts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and ribosomal protein genes were depleted in the uninfected cells after P limitation but were enriched during phage infection of P-starved cells. Cyanophage P-SSM2 contains pstS, and pstS and its adjacent gene g247 of unknown function were the only phage genes that were enriched under P-limited conditions. We further found that the host pstS transcript number per cell decreased after infection, however, it was still much higher in the P-limited infected cells than that in the nutrient-replete cells. Moreover, phage pstS transcript number per cell was ~20 times higher than the host copy, which may help maintain the host phosphate uptake rate during infection.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus play a crucial role in the ocean \u2019 s biogeochemical cycling, but it remains controversial how they will respond to global warming. Here we assessed the response to temperature (22 \u2013 30/C14C) of the growth dynam-ics and gene expression profiles of a Red Sea Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) in a non-axenic culture. Both the specific growth rate (0.55 \u2013 0.80 day/C01) and cell size (0.04 \u2013 0.07 \u03bcm3)o f Prochlorococcus increased sig- nificantly with temperature. The primary production released extracellularly ranged from 20% to 34%, with humic-like fluorescent compounds increasing up to fivefold as Prochlorococcus reached its maximum abundance. At 30/C14C, genes involved in carbon fixation such as CsoS2 and CsoS3 and photosynthetic electron transport including PTOX were downregulated, suggesting a cellular homeostasis and energy saving mechanism response. In contrast, PTOX was found upregulated at 22 /C14C and 24 /C14C. Similar results were found for transaldolase, related to carbon metabolism, and citrate synthase, an important enzyme in the TCA cycle. Our data suggest that in spite of the currently warm temperatures of the Red Sea, Prochlorococcus can modulate its gene expression profiles to permit growth at temperatures lower than its optimum temperature (28 /C14C) but is unable to cope with temperatures exceeding 30 /C14C.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus is a globally important marine cyanobacterium that lacks the gene catalase and relies on 'helper' bacteria such as Alteromonas to remove reactive oxygen species. Increasing atmospheric CO2 decreases the need for carbon concentrating mechanisms and photorespiration in phytoplankton, potentially altering their metabolism and microbial interactions even when carbon is not limiting growth. Here, Prochlorococcus (VOL4, MIT9312) was co-cultured with Alteromonas (strain EZ55) under ambient (400 p.p.m.) and elevated CO2 (800 p.p.m.). Under elevated CO2, Prochlorococcus had a significantly longer lag phase and greater apparent die-offs after transfers suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. Whole-transcriptome analysis of Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the carbon fixation operon, including carboxysome subunits, corresponding with significantly fewer carboxysome structures observed by electron microscopy. Prochlorococcus co-culture responsive gene 1 had significantly increased expression in elevated CO2, potentially indicating a shift in the microbial interaction. Transcriptome analysis of Alteromonas in co-culture with Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the catalase gene, known to be critical in relieving oxidative stress in Prochlorococcus by removing hydrogen peroxide. The decrease in catalase gene expression was corroborated by a significant ~ 6-fold decrease in removal rates of hydrogen peroxide from co-cultures. These data suggest Prochlorococcus may be more vulnerable to oxidative stress under elevated CO2 in part from a decrease in ecosystem services provided by heterotrophs like Alteromonas. This work highlights the importance of considering microbial interactions in the context of a changing ocean.",
