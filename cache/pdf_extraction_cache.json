      "abstract": "This study investigates how two Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 (high-light I) and MIT9313 (low-light IV), change gene expression in response to co-culture with Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3. The Alteromonas strain enhances MIT9313 growth at low density but inhibits it at higher density, with no effect on MED4. Early transcriptomic responses show no nutrient-starvation signatures; MED4 downregulates photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and stress response genes, while MIT9313 upregulates these pathways. Differential expression of outer membrane modification genes, efflux transporters, and lanthipeptide-related genes (prochlorosins) suggests a targeted response to the heterotroph. Novel co-culture responsive gene families (CCRG-1 and CCRG-2) are encoded by many short genes and may be released into the medium.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene ( idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.",

Seven conditions were tested; blue light elicited a strong transcriptional response, with high white light responses resembling blue light. Results suggest blue-light sensing is mediated via a blue-light receptor, with bacterial cryptochromes as candidates, and indicate a signaling pathway linked to the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, as inferred from genes responding similarly to red and blue light and to the photosystem II inhibitor DCMU.

      "abstract": "The study used DNA microarrays to identify phosphate (P) starvation\u2013induced genes in two Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 (high-light) and MIT9313 (low-light). pstS served as a marker of P limitation; MED4 showed a gradual induction of 30 genes and MIT9313 showed widespread down-regulation with 176 genes differentially expressed. Only seven up-regulated genes were shared, largely including phoB and pstABCS; a phoE-like porin downstream of phoB was induced in both strains. The results reveal two clusters of P-acquisition genes centered around phoB, with significant genome variability in the phoB region across 11 strains, not strictly correlated with rRNA phylogeny. Metagenomic data from the Sargasso Sea supported the prevalence of MED4-like P-acquisition genes in low-P environments, indicating genome-wide adaptation to P availability.",
