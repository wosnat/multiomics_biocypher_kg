      "abstract": "This study investigates how two Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 (high-light I) and MIT9313 (low-light IV), change gene expression in response to co-culture with Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3. The Alteromonas strain enhances MIT9313 growth at low density but inhibits it at higher density, with no effect on MED4. Early transcriptomic responses show no nutrient-starvation signatures; MED4 downregulates photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and stress response genes, while MIT9313 upregulates these pathways. Differential expression of outer membrane modification genes, efflux transporters, and lanthipeptide-related genes (prochlorosins) suggests a targeted response to the heterotroph. Novel co-culture responsive gene families (CCRG-1 and CCRG-2) are encoded by many short genes and may be released into the medium.",

      "abstract": "Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene ( idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.",

      "abstract": "The study used DNA microarrays to identify phosphate (P) starvation\u2013induced genes in two Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 (high-light) and MIT9313 (low-light). pstS served as a marker of P limitation; MED4 showed a gradual induction of 30 genes and MIT9313 showed widespread down-regulation with 176 genes differentially expressed. Only seven up-regulated genes were shared, largely including phoB and pstABCS; a phoE-like porin downstream of phoB was induced in both strains. The results reveal two clusters of P-acquisition genes centered around phoB, with significant genome variability in the phoB region across 11 strains, not strictly correlated with rRNA phylogeny. Metagenomic data from the Sargasso Sea supported the prevalence of MED4-like P-acquisition genes in low-P environments, indicating genome-wide adaptation to P availability.",

      "abstract": "The transcriptomic responses of bacteria to environmental stresses have been studied extensively, yet we know little about how stressed cells respond to bacteriophage infection. Here, we conducted the first whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) study of stressed bacteria to phage infection by infecting the marine picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus NATL2A with cyanomyovirus P-SSM2 under P limitation, a strong selective force in the oceans. Transcripts of the P-acquisition genes in the uninfected cells were enriched after P limitation, including the high-affinity phosphate-binding protein gene pstS. They were still enriched in the infected cells under P-limited conditions. In contrast, transcripts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and ribosomal protein genes were depleted in the uninfected cells after P limitation but were enriched during phage infection of P-starved cells. Cyanophage P-SSM2 contains pstS, and pstS and its adjacent gene g247 of unknown function were the only phage genes that were enriched under P-limited conditions. We further found that the host pstS transcript number per cell decreased after infection, however, it was still much higher in the P-limited infected cells than that in the nutrient-replete cells. Moreover, phage pstS transcript number per cell was ~20 times higher than the host copy, which may help maintain the host phosphate uptake rate during infection.",
